# ## Run builds using Google Cloud Build ##
#
# This script runs builds using Google Cloud Build. It expects a single
# argument of the build name to run. Valid build names are the basenames of the
# scripts in the `builds/` directory. An optional `--distro=<distro>` flag may
# be specified to indicate which `Dockerfile.<distro>` to run the named build
# in, and this build is submitted to Cloud Build to run. A distro of "local"
# (the default) indicates to run the build locally, without docker, using the
# invoking user's operating system and environment.
#
# Usage: ./build.sh [options] <build-name>
#
#   Options:
#     -d|--distro <name>    The distro name to use.
#
#   Build names:
