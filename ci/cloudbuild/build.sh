# ## Run builds using Google Cloud Build ##
#
# This script runs builds using Google Cloud Build. It expects a single
# argument of the build name to run. Valid build names are the basenames of the
# scripts in the `builds/` directory. If this script is invoked from a user at
# a terminal it submits the Cloud Build job on the user's behalf. If the script
# is invoked from within a Cloud Build environment (determined by checking
# ${BUILD_ID}), then it'll kick off the named build.
#
# Usage: ./build.sh <build-name>
