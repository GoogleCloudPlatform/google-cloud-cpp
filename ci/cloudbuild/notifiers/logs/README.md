# Generate Log Index for External Developers

We use a Cloud Run deployment to generate an `index.html` GCS object listing
all the logs for each PR, ore specifically, each commit SHA in each PR. This
GCS object is posted on a bucket with public read access, and referenced from
comments in the PR so contributors can find it.

This document describes the steps necessary to set up this Cloud Run
deployment. The main audience is `google-cloud-cpp` team members that need
to update the deployment. You are expected to be familiar with Docker, and
Google Cloud Platform, particularly with Cloud Run and GCS.

## Prerequisites

Verify the [docker tool][docker] is functional on your workstation:

```shell
docker run hello-world
# Output: Hello from Docker! and then some more informational messages.
```

Verify the [pack tool][pack-install] is functional on our workstation. These
instructions were tested with `v0.17.0`, although they should work with newer
versions. Some commands may not work with older versions.

```shell
pack version
# Output: a version number, e.g., 0.17.0+git-d9cb4e7.build-2045
```

## Enable Writing on the Destination Bucket

The Cloud Run deployment needs to write to the destination bucket.
The deployment runs under the default GCP compute service account, the
following command grants this service account permissions to write into
the bucket. These commands need to run only once, they are here in case
we ever move the build to a different project.

```shell
BUCKET_NAME="cloud-cpp-community-publiclogs"
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects list \
    --filter="project_id=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
    --format="value(project_number)" \
    --limit=1)

gsutil iam ch \
    "serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin" \
    "gs://${BUCKET_NAME}"
```

## Create the Docker image

We use buildspacks to compile the code in the `function/` directory into a
Docker image. At the end of this build the docker image will reside in your
workstation. We will then push the image to GCR (Google Container Registry)
and use it from Cloud Run.

```shell
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=... # The project running the builds
pack build  --builder gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:latest \
     --env "GOOGLE_FUNCTION_SIGNATURE_TYPE=cloudevent" \
     --env "GOOGLE_FUNCTION_TARGET=index_build_logs" \
     --path "function" \
     "gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/index-build-logs"
```

## Push the Docker image to GCR

```shell
docker push "gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/index-build-logs:latest"
````

## Deploy to Cloud Run

```shell
gcloud run deploy index-build-logs \
    --project="${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
    --image="gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/index-build-logs:latest" \
    --set-env-vars="BUCKET_NAME=${BUCKET_NAME}" \
    --region="us-central1" \
    --platform="managed" \
    --no-allow-unauthenticated
```

## Set up a trigger

Deployments in Cloud Run are (basically) http servers, a trigger converts
the Cloud Pub/Sub messages generated by Cloud Build into events that can
be consumed by the deployment. Note that this is the step where we specify
the `cloud-builds` topic as a source of these events.

```shell
gcloud beta eventarc triggers create index-build-logs-trigger \
    --project="${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
    --location="us-central1" \
    --destination-run-service="index-build-logs" \
    --destination-run-region="us-central1" \
    --transport-topic="cloud-builds" \
    --matching-criteria="type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished" \
    --service-account="${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"
```
